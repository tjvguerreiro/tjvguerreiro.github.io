We had two short papers accepted at ACM ASSETS 2017, to be held in Baltimore, Oct 29-Nov 2. One focuses on <a href="../pubs/context-q-support_crc.pdf">in-context crowdsourced smartphone support for blind people</a>. The second presents <a href="../pubs/psi_assets_CRC.pdf">personalizable virtual overlays</a> to improve system-wide non-visual accessibility to smartphones. A <a href="../pubs/psi_trailer.mp4">demonstration video</a> is also available. Congrats to André Rodrigues, that also had his <a href="../dc_assets17_andre_proposal.pdf">Doctoral Consortium proposal</a> accepted, and the SOS team. See you in Baltimore!
